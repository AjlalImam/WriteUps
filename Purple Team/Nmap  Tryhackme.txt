What is the first switch listed in the help menu for a 'Syn Scan' (more on this later!)?

-sS
Which switch would you use for a "UDP scan"?

-sU
If you wanted to detect which operating system the target is running on, which switch would you use?

-O
Nmap provides a switch to detect the version of the services running on the target. What is this switch?

-sV
The default output provided by nmap often does not provide enough information for a pentester. How would you increase the verbosity?

-v
Verbosity level one is good, but verbosity level two is better! How would you set the verbosity level to two?
(Note: it's highly advisable to always use at least this option)

-vv
We should always save the output of our scans -- this means that we only need to run the scan once (reducing network traffic and thus chance of detection), and gives us a reference to use when writing reports for clients.

What switch would you use to save the nmap results in three major formats?

-oA
What switch would you use to save the nmap results in a "normal" format?

-oN
A very useful output format: how would you save results in a "grepable" format?

-oG
Sometimes the results we're getting just aren't enough. If we don't care about how loud we are, we can enable "aggressive" mode. This is a shorthand switch that activates service detection, operating system detection, a traceroute and common script scanning.

How would you activate this setting?

-A
Nmap offers five levels of "timing" template. These are essentially used to increase the speed your scan runs at. Be careful though: higher speeds are noisier, and can incur errors!

How would you set the timing template to level 5?

-T5
We can also choose which port(s) to scan.

How would you tell nmap to only scan port 80?

-p 80
How would you tell nmap to scan ports 1000-1500?

-p 1000-1500
A very useful option that should not be ignored:

How would you tell nmap to scan all ports?

-p-
How would you activate a script from the nmap scripting library (lots more on this later!)?

--script
How would you activate all of the scripts in the "vuln" category?

--script=vuln

This has a variety of advantages for us as hackers:
-It can be used to bypass older Intrusion Detection systems as they are looking out for a full three way handshake. This is often no longer the case with modern IDS solutions; it is for this reason that SYN scans are still frequently referred to as "stealth" scans.
-SYN scans are often not logged by applications listening on open ports, as standard practice is to log a connection once it's been fully established. Again, this plays into the idea of SYN scans being stealthy.
-Without having to bother about completing (and disconnecting from) a three-way handshake for every port, SYN scans are significantly faster than a standard TCP Connect scan.

There are, however, a couple of disadvantages to SYN scans, namely:
-They require sudo permissions[1] in order to work correctly in Linux. This is because SYN scans require the ability to create raw packets (as opposed to the full TCP handshake), which is a privilege only the root user has by default.
-Unstable services are sometimes brought down by SYN scans, which could prove problematic if a client has provided a production environment for the test.
